Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
- It is a branch of computer science that design, develop, test, and maintain high-quality software systems by applying engineering principles, methods, and tools 
- Software engineering is essential in the technology industry because it enables the creation of software applications and systems that power key areas of modern life, such 
  as communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
 - Waterfall: It is a linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next one begins. It includes requirements analysis, system design, implementation, integration, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
 - Agile: It is a project management methodology that prioritizes iterative and adaptable software development, customer involvement, and team collaboration.
 - Scrum: Agile framework emphasizing small, self-organizing teams working in short iterations called sprints.
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- In waterfall, development and testing are done in separate phases after design is complete which leads to late discovery of issues. while in agile, development and testing occur concurently during each iteration allowing continuos testing.
- In the Waterfall model, each team member has specific roles and duties that are clearly defined from the start. In contrast, the Agile model allows team members to collaborate on various parts of the project as needed, leading to a more flexible and self-organizing team.thing makes it appropriate for enhancing existing web application with new features based on user feedback.
 
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- Software Developer: Writing code and implementing software solutions.
- Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensuring that the software meets quality standards and functions correctly before it is released to users.
- Project Manager: Oversee the planning, execution, and completion of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
- Intergrated Development Environments (IDEs) provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code. Examples are: Visual Studio, Eclipse, and IntelliJ IDEA.
- Version Control Systems (VCS) are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members for example Git, Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- Common challenges are: Changing Requirements, tight deadlines, and technical debts. They can be overcame through effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- Unit: Testing individual components or modules of software.
- Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
- System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
- Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
- Testing helps identify and resolve defects early in development, resulting in higher-quality software products.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
- Prompt engineering is designing and refining questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.
- Its importances is that it helps make questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what you need and give a non confusing answers.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
- "Tell me about Kenya"
- Improved: "Give an overview of Kenya's major tourist attractions, including details on popular destinations and activities."
